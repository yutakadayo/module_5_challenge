## Final Thoughts

Weighting the portfolio more heavily to stocks will not allow the credit union members to retire after only 10 years.

The mean of 30 years plan is 9.43 (943%), while 10 years plan is 3.29 (329%). 

In order to obtain similar (900%) return, the riskier portfolio requires almost same amount of time if I just look at the number.
